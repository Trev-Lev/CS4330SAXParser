# CS4330SAXParser

An assignment for CS4330, in which we use a SAX XML parser to display a model of the XML file given. This application only takes XML files, and displays nodes with tabs to mark their level. 

In the XML files themselves, newline characters may be present. This can result in a weird system of 0-2 newlines inbetween different elements, depending on whether there was one present in the original file or not.
